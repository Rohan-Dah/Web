    <!--Video tag works same as the image tag. SRC has the source location. The location has to be relative not absolute. Some attributes like width, muted, controls, poster, autoplay and loop is being used.
      Width works the same for image as well as video.
      Muted means your video will start muted in the webpage.
      Controls will display the controls like play/pause, volume to the video.
      Poster will work as a thumnail as it will take an src input which should be relative.
      autoplay will make your video automatically play as the webpage is loaded.
      Loop works as an unending video which will replay after the video is finished.  -->

<!--The comment section
Tags are the set of commands which tells the browser we want this in the form of this:
Like some text we want in the form of header and some of it we want in the form of paragraph,
so <h1>-<h6> and <p> are the tags used repectively

Attributes is something which we use to define our tag even better better. Like we want this in this text.
Like in list (line 34) we used attribute type with value as Roman which indicated we want to use the ordered list in capital Roman Numberss.

Nesting of elements really turns out to be heavily cutomizable..

Nesting of list is also done here in line 37. 

In line 10 we used some entities which are a given set of code used to identify some symbol or letter or anything which may not be present on the keyboard.
